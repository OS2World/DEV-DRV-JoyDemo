Advanced OS/2 Joystick Device Driver - Version 1.0

BRIEF
  The Advanced OS/2 Joystick Device Driver has two main purposes:
    * To eliminate the joystick response 'flicker' effect seen in many
      DOS games running under OS/2.
    * To provide a standard interface for OS/2 game programmers to use
      the PC joystick port in their products.

      >> Please note that there are also plans to allow DOS applications
         to speak with the driver, allowing DOS games running under OS/2
         very efficient and reliable readings of the joystick port.

// 1. INSTALLATION


   PLEASE NOTE: If you've installed an older version of this driver (0.1a),
                you will have to delete the GAMEDD.SYS, GAMEVDD.SYS and
                GAMEDD.DOC files from your \OS2 directory manually.  Also,
                please remove references to these drivers from your CONFIG.SYS.

   A. "AUTOMATIC" installation.

       The device driver can be installed using the OS/2 device
       driver installer.  Follow these steps:

      - If you received the joystick driver as a ZIP file, extract it
        into a temporary directory.

      - Open your OS/2 System Setup folder and execute 'Device Driver Install',
        or type 'DDINSTAL' at an OS/2 command prompt.

      - Change the SOURCE DIRECTORY entry to match the temporary directory
        in which the joystick driver is located.

      - The DESTINATION DIRECTORY should match the root directory of your
        OS/2 boot drive.

      - When you click on the INSTALL button, the Advanced OS/2 Joystick
        Driver should appear in a list box.

      - Select the driver by clicking on its name, then click the OK button.
        This will copy the device driver files into a directory named MPCA on
        the root of your boot drive and add the device driver loading lines to
        your CONFIG.SYS

      - You can now exit the Device Driver Install program and reboot
        your OS/2 system to enable the driver.

   B. "MANUAL" installation.

      - Create a directory on the root of your boot drive named MPCA.

      - If you received the joystick driver as a ZIP file, extract it
        into the MPCA directory, otherwise, copy all the driver files
        into that directory.

      - Add the following lines to your CONFIG.SYS file:

		DEVICE=x:\mpca\gamedd.sys
		DEVICE=x:\mpca\gamevdd.sys

        (replacing 'x' with the letter of your boot drive, of course)

      - Reboot your system to enable the driver.


// 2. USAGE

   The driver adds two options to your DOS SETTINGS notebook.
   To change these options, simply bring up the settings notebook
   for a particular DOS session icon, choose the SESSION tab, and click
   on the DOS SETTINGS button.

   GAME_DIRECT_ACCESS

	ON - This setting essentially disables the driver by giving the
             DOS program direct access to the game port.  You should only
             enable this setting if you're having problems with control
             of a DOS game and suspect that the joystick driver may be
             at fault.  This is also useful for testing the difference
             between having the driver enabled and disabled for a particular
             game.

       OFF - The default setting.  This prevents the DOS program from talking
             directly to the game port, and thus allows the joystick driver
             to do its work.

   GAME_DIGITAL_RESPONSE

        ON - The default setting.  When this option is enabled, the driver
             reports information back to the DOS program in such a way as
             to make your joystick look like a GamePad, even if your joystick
             is analog.

       OFF - Analog joysticks will look like analog joysticks ...


   MANUAL RESPONSE SETTINGS ADJUSTMENT 

	The values that the driver returns to the application using it
	can be manually adjusted in case of unusual behavior.  For example,
	some games may act as if the joystick is being held constantly toward
	one direction.  If this happens, switch out of the running DOS
	application (by using CTRL-ESC, for example) and execute the
	JOYTUNE.EXE program found in the MPCA subdirectory.

	The program will display the values the joystick driver currently
	responds with when in DIGITAL RESPONSE mode.  If you choose to change
	these values, you will be prompted first for X-axis values, followed
	by Y-axis values.  Enter three numbers for each axis, representing
	the values which should be returned to the game or application.

	Modifying these values may improve or resolve odd joystick response
	problems.  For example, if your program acts as if the joystick
	is being held constantly towards the upper-left, then values the
	joystick driver is returning for the 'centered' position are too
	low for each axis.  Try raising the middle value for each axis using
	JOYTUNE.  You'll likely need to adjust the other values as well.
	In most cases, you'll be able to simply switch back and forth between
	the game you're trying to use and the JOYTUNE program until the
	adjustment is refined.

	There are plans for a more user-friendly version of JOYTUNE soon,
	which would include the ability to save your modifications for
	future use.

// 4. KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

   There are currently no known bugs with the driver itself.

   There seems to be a limitation in the number of option settings which
   can be added to the DOS SETTINGS notebook.  If nothing happens when
   you click on the DOS SETTINGS button, then you've most likely run into
   this limitation.  Our only suggestion at this point is that you
   remove other virtual device drivers which add options to this notebook
   from your CONFIG.SYS.  If you're using Ray Gwinn's SIO driver but
   don't have any DOS programs which really need it, then the VSIO.SYS
   virtual device driver is a good candidate since it adds *many* options
   to the notebook.

   The following is a list of games which will *not* work with joystick
   support under OS/2 at all.  Unfortunately, the driver can't do anything
   about fixing these problems.  Since the great majority of games *do*
   work with a joystick under OS/2, we suggest you contact the authors of
   the game in question and ask them to fix the problem.  Given enough such
   requests, it is possible that they may actually do something about it.

	DOOM II: The game will simply stop at its title screen if you
                 configure it for joystick use.  No amount of coaxing seems
                 to change its mind.  Considering that sound effects don't
                 work under OS/2 either, it almost seems as if Id is
                 purposefully trying to make life difficult for OS/2 users ...


// 5. Q&A

   Q: Does this driver add extra overhead to my OS/2 system?
   A: The driver needs to poll the game port for new joystick information.
      However, it only does this when an application (game) is using it and
      is idle otherwise.

   Q: Will this driver conflict with the WatchCat monitor program?
   A: No.  Be aware that WatchCat will still be checking the joystick
      buttons, even while games are running.  We suggest you start
      WatchCat with the /GA option, which would require you to press all
      joystick buttons simultaneously to start WatchCat.  Alternately,
      you could disable WatchCat before starting a game and re-enable it
      afterwards using the TOGGLE option.  Check the WatchCat documentation.
      Please note that WatchCat 2.0 does not have an option equivalent to
      the /GA in previous versions.  The authors are aware of this and
      said they would add it again in a later release.

   Q: Doom II just locks up at the title screen!  What's wrong?
   A: Read the KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS section above.

   Q: Nothing happens when I click on the DOS SETTINGS button!  What's wrong?
   A: Read the KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS section above.

   Q: Will the driver work with the XYZ joystick??
   A: The driver is not designed to work with a particular kind of joystick.
      It simply reads the joystick *port* for position information and
      feeds that back to the DOS program at the appropriate time.  It is then
      up to your program to interpret the data correctly.  If you're having
      problems with a particular kind of joystick, please contact us
      at the address below.

   Q: Will this driver only work with the Gravis UltraSound?
   A: No.  It is a general-purpose driver which should work with
      any standard game adapter.

   Q: Why don't the driver's DOS SETTINGS have descriptions in the settings
      notebook?
   A: It appears to be impossible for third-party virtual device drivers
      to add descriptions to their settings within the DOS SETTINGS notebook.
      Bug IBM about it!
