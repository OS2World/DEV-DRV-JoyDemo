SpiceWare source code sample

This archive includes sample source code for reading the joystick ports under
OS/2.  The sample programs runs at an OS/2 command prompt.  Press control-C to
stop the program from running.

If you do not already have the joystick driver installed you will need to
install it. Start by unzipping JOYSTICK.ZIP, then run INSTALL.CMD.  After
installation, you will have to reboot in order to cause the new device driver
to be loaded.
